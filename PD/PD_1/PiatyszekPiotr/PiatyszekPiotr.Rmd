# 1) dataMaid: Your Assistant for Documenting Supervised Data Quality Screening in R

From the article's abstract, where `dataMaid` package is described as implementing *"an extensive and customizable suite of quality assessment aids that can be applied to a dataset in order to identify potential problems in its variables. The results are presented in an auto-generated, non-technical, stand-alone overview document intended to be perused by an investigator with an understanding of the variables in the data, but not necessarily knowledge of R"* we can find out what the package is for.

[the article page link](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index.php/jss/article/view/v090i06)

[CRAN link](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dataMaid/index.html)

Firstly, the installation - it went smoothly and fast.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('dataMaid')
```

#### Creating a data overview report

*"The `makeDataReport()` function is the primary workhorse of dataMaid and it is the only function needed to generate a data report using the standard battery of tests. The data report itself is an overview document, intended for reading by humans, in either PDF, HTML or Word (.docx) format"*

There was an appendix provided as an example of a data report in PDF format, produced by calling `makeDataReport()` on the dataset `toyData` available in `dataMaid`.

```{r}
library("dataMaid")
data("toyData", package = "dataMaid")
toyData
```

The dataset was loaded successfully. 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
makeDataReport(toyData)
```

An R markdown file and a rendered PDF, Word or HTML overview document are produced, saved to the working directory and opened for immediate inspection. It all worked as descibed.

[PDF output](dataMaid_toyData.pdf)

```{r eval=FALSE}
# html output
makeDataReport(toyData, output = "html", onlyProblematic = TRUE, maxProbVals = 2, replace = TRUE)

# html - options set not to render nor open
makeDataReport(toyData, output = "html", render = FALSE, openResult = FALSE, replace = TRUE)
```
The html output also worked correctly, so by far this article's reproducibility is great.

[HTML output](dataMaid_toyData.html)

Now, let's see how some helper functions work:

```{r}
allSummaryFunctions()

setSummaries()

defaultCharacterSummaries()

defaultFactorChecks()
```
The results are exactly as expected. 

#### Data cleaning by hand: An example

```{r}

check(toyData$events) 

check(toyData$events, checks = setChecks(numeric = "identifyMissing"))

identifyMissing(toyData$events)

missEvents <- identifyMissing(toyData$events)
str(missEvents)
toyData$events[toyData$events %in% missEvents$problemValues] <- NA
identifyMissing(toyData$events)

```

Let's check `visualize{)` and `summarize()` functions' results`

```{r}
visualize(toyData$events)
summarize(toyData$events)
summarize(toyData$events, summaries = setSummaries( numeric = defaultNumericSummaries(remove = c("variableType", "countMissing"))))

```

All results are exactly as expected.



#### A worked example: Dirty presidents
This time the task was to create a report describing the `presidentData` dataset, which is available in dataMaid and use the information from this report to clean up the data. 

`presidentData` is a slightly mutilated dataset with information about the 45 first US presidents, but with a few common data issues and a blind passenger.

```{r eval=FALSE}
data("presidentData", package = "dataMaid")
head(presidentData)

makeDataReport(presidentData, replace = TRUE,
 treatXasY = list("Name" = "character"), checks = setChecks(character =
 defaultCharacterChecks(remove = "identifyLoners")),
 reportTitle = "Dirty president data")
```

[PDF output](dataMaid_presidentData.pdf) is correct again.


```{r}
# df modifications
presidentData$lastName[presidentData$lastName == " Truman"] <- "Truman"
presidentData$stateOfBirth[presidentData$stateOfBirth == "New york"] <- "New York"
presidentData$assassinationAttempt <- factor(presidentData$assassinationAttempt)
presidentData$ageAtInauguration <- as.numeric(presidentData$ageAtInauguration)
presidentData$ageAtInauguration <- as.numeric(as.character(presidentData$ageAtInauguration))
presidentData$lastName[presidentData$firstName == "."]
presidentData$firstName[presidentData$firstName == "."] <- "Donald"

# Now, we have the outlier birthday stored and can use it 
# to select and print the appropriate observation in the dataset:
birthdayOutlierVal <- identifyOutliers(presidentData$birthday)$problemValues
presidentData[presidentData$birthday == birthdayOutlierVal, ]

presidentData <-  presidentData[presidentData$birthday != birthdayOutlierVal, ]
summarize(presidentData$presidencyYears)

presidentData[is.na(presidentData$presidencyYears) |
 presidentData$presidencyYears %in%
 identifyOutliers(presidentData$presidencyYears)$problemValues,
 c("firstName", "lastName", "presidencyYears")]
presidentData$presidencyYears[presidentData$lastName == "Obama"] <- 8
```
```{r eval=FALSE}
makeDataReport(presidentData, vol = "_cleaned",
 treatXasY = list(Name = "character", complex = "numeric"),
 checks = setChecks(character =
 defaultCharacterChecks(remove = "identifyLoners")),
 reportTitle = "Dirty president data - cleaned", replace = TRUE)
```
The last created a new data report stored in the file [dataMaid_presidentData_cleaned.pdf](dataMaid_presidentData_cleaned.pdf) 

#### Rubbing down data cleaning challenges


```{r, eval=FALSE}
makeDataReport(toyData, open = FALSE, quiet = "silent", vol = paste("_", format(Sys.time(), "%m-%d%-%y_%H.%M"), sep = ""))
```
If, e.g., the report was created at 3 pm on June 30, 2019, the report will have the file name dataMaid_toyData_06-30-2019_15.00.pdf, making it easy to find.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
makeDataReport(toyData, onlyProblematic = TRUE, mode = "check", replace = TRUE)
```
Only the checking results were printed, and only for variables where problems were identified. 

```{r}
toyChecks <- check(toyData)
foo <- function(x) { any(sapply(x, function(y) y[["problem"]]))}
sapply(toyChecks, foo)
```


### Verdict
This article's reproducibility is **very good**.

# 2) clustMixType: User-Friendly Clustering of Mixed-Type Data in R by Gero Szepannek

the R package `clustMixType` which provides an implementation of k-prototypes in R


[the article page link](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2018/RJ-2018-048/index.html)



The installation went smoothly and fast.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("clustMixType")

# also will be needed:
install.packages("wesanderson")
```

We tried to reproduce the output od the example from the article:

```{r}
# generate toy data with factors and numerics

n   <- 100
prb <- 0.9
muk <- 1.5 
clusid <- rep(1:4, each = n)

x1 <- sample(c("A","B"), 2*n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(prb, 1-prb))
x1 <- c(x1, sample(c("A","B"), 2*n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(1-prb, prb)))
x1 <- as.factor(x1)

x2 <- sample(c("A","B"), 2*n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(prb, 1-prb))
x2 <- c(x2, sample(c("A","B"), 2*n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(1-prb, prb)))
x2 <- as.factor(x2)

x3 <- c(rnorm(n, mean = -muk), rnorm(n, mean = muk), rnorm(n, mean = -muk), rnorm(n, mean = muk))
x4 <- c(rnorm(n, mean = -muk), rnorm(n, mean = muk), rnorm(n, mean = -muk), rnorm(n, mean = muk))

x <- data.frame(x1,x2,x3,x4)

library(clustMixType)
kpres <- kproto(x = x, k = 4)
kpres # output 1
summary(kpres) # output 2
library(wesanderson)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
clprofiles(kpres, x, col = wes_palette("Royal1", 4, type = "continuous")) # figure 1
```

The resulting output is of the form as it should. It isn't identic as we used `sample()` function.


```{r, results='hide'}
Es <- numeric(10)
for(i in 1:10){
kpres <- kproto(x, k = i, nstart = 5)
Es[i] <- kpres$tot.withinss
}
```
```{r}
plot(1:10, Es, type = "b", ylab = "Objective Function", xlab = "# Clusters",
main = "Scree Plot") # figure 2

```

### Verdict
This article's reproducibility is **good**.

# 3) Forecast Combinations in R using the `ForecastComb` Package

This package is to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive implementation of the most common ways in which forecasts can be combined. 

[the article page link](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2018/RJ-2018-052/index.html)


The installation - it lasted a while, but it was ok in the end.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ForecastComb")
```

Firstly, we gonna check if a simple simulation example is reproducible:
```{r}
library(ForecastComb)
actual <- rnorm(100)
forecasts <- matrix(rnorm(1000, 1), 100, 10)
input_data <- foreccomb(actual, forecasts)
# Manual Selection of Trimming Factor:
model1 <- comb_TA(input_data, trim_factor = 0.3)
# Assess accuracy of the combined forecast:
model1$Accuracy_Train

# Algorithm-Optimized Selection of Trimming Factor:
model2 <- comb_TA(input_data, criterion = "RMSE")
# Assess accuracy of the combined forecast:
model2$Accuracy_Train

```
There was a misspell 'model1$AccuracyTrain' didn't work at first. After adding the symbol '_' it is all good.

#### UK Electricity Supply: An Empirical Example

The ForecastComb package includes the dataset `electricity`, which is a multivariate time series of monthly UK electricity supply (in GWh) from January 2007 to March 2017, and 5 univariate time series forecasts for the same series and period. The observed data series is sourced from the International Energy Agency (IEA, 2017).

```{r}
 data(electricity)
 train.obs <- electricity[1:84, 6]
 train.pred <- electricity[1:84, 1:5]
 test.obs <- electricity[85:123, 6]
 test.pred <- electricity[85:123, 1:5]
 input_data <- foreccomb(train.obs, train.pred, test.obs, test.pred)
 
 cs_dispersion(input_data, measure = "SD", plot = TRUE)
```
```{r results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, error=FALSE}
  ####### ESTIMATION OF STATIC FORECAST COMBINATIONS ########
SA <- comb_SA(input_data)
OLS_static <- comb_OLS(input_data)
EIG1_static <- comb_EIG1(input_data)
EIG4_static <- comb_EIG4(input_data, criterion = "MAE")
 ###### ESTIMATION OF DYNAMIC FORECAST COMBINATIONS
OLS_dyn <- rolling_combine(input_data, "comb_OLS")
EIG1_dyn <- rolling_combine(input_data, "comb_EIG1")
EIG4_dyn <- rolling_combine(input_data, "comb_EIG4", criterion = "MAE")
```
```{r}
summary(OLS_static)

##### ACTUAL VS FITTED PLOT #####
plot(OLS_dyn)
 ##### COMBINATION WEIGHTS #####
colMeans(OLS_dyn$Weights)

```

The plots and results match the article.

### Verdict
This article's reproducibility is **very good**.
